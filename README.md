# Lending Club Case Study

## Business Understanding
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

 

The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

 

In this case study,we have used EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.


## Conclusions
* Applications  with  ‘Higher amounts’ loans (> $15000) should be thoroughly reviewed. 

* Applications with purpose 'debt consolidation’ and grade 'G to B' should be thoroughly reviewed before approving their loan application.

* Lending club should raise interest rates or stop loans to ‘Small businesses’ as there are more than 25% of defaulters in this segment.

* While providing loans for term 60 months the club should do a background check for public records of the applicants. 

* Public record should be checked for all borrowers because borrowers with higher number of public records tend to have a higher default rate.

* It is believed that the large number of open account tend to have higher default rate. However, our analysis did not show significant differences. 
   There is not enough data to conclude that borrowers with more than 30 accounts tend to have higher default rate.

* Lending club should carefully review interest rate of Low Grades applicants because the Loans having higher interest rate have more defaulters.
